## NoSeat.co in a nutshell

Public transport is usually the most convenient and cheapest way of moving around cities. 
It is also a great way of experiencing cities just like locals do. 

While Google Maps and similar apps have made navigation easy, paying for public transport is still confusing. **NoSeat.co** aims to fill that gap. 

NoSeat.co is a love letter to public transport. Every city page includes a section on how you can use public transport to explore cities. I want to encourage everyone to use public transport as much as possible. 

Finally, every page has a section on general tips when travelling abroad.
