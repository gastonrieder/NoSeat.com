This site is a love letter to public transport. 

Before you ask, the site name pays explicit homage to [The Man in Seat Sixty-One](https://www.seat61.com). Mark's website has been a true inspiration for NoSeat.com. Since you can't make a seat reservation on public transport. 

Public transport is what makes our cities function. It's what makes them livable. It's what makes them fun. It's what makes them thrive. Without public transport, our cities would still be villages. 

Public transport is both an invariably universal and intimately local experience. No journey to Paris is complete without travelling on the métro. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more iconic landmark of London than the double-decker bus. And hearing "stand clear of the closing doors please" immediately harks me back to New York.

## Why did I name the site NoSeat.com? 
The site name pays explicit homage to [The Man in Seat Sixty-One](https://www.seat61.com). Mark's website has been a true inspiration for NoSeat.com. Seat Sixty-one refers to Mark's favourite seat on the Eurostar. Since we can't make a seat reservation on public transport, our favourite seat is... no seat!
