## NoSeat.com in a nutshell

Public transport is usually the most convenient and cheapest way of moving around cities. 
It is also a great way of experiencing cities just like locals do. 

While Google Maps and similar apps have made navigation easy, paying for public transport is still confusing. **NoSeat.com** aims to fill that gap by providing information about how to pay for public transportÂ in major cities around the globe.

NoSeat.com is a love letter to public transport. Every city page includes a section on public transport heritage, and how you can use public transport to explore cities in more rewarding ways than a hop-on hop-off bus or private tour. I want to encourage everyone to use public transport as much as possible. 

Finally, every page has a section on general tips when travelling abroad.
