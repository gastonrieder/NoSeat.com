# About NoSeat.co

## Who am I? 

Hello! I'm Gaston, creator of NoSeat.co. 

I've always been passionate about public transport and urban life in general. I am fascinated by the creativity that is unlocked when humans come together.

## How did I come up with the idea for NoSeat.co?

I've spent a lot of time travelling around the world, exploring and living in different cities. 
As an urban enthusiast, public transport has been a feature of my life since day one.

Over time, I noticed that navigation itself was not a major problem when stepping into a new public transport system - Google Maps is usually good enough. If not, there is always a local alternative app. 

The problem is actually figuring out what tickets to buy! 
Is there an app I should download? Or do I go to a vending machine? 
If so, what tickets do I buy? Ah, I can pay contactless, great... no, wait, I can only do it on buses but not on trams. Ugh, this is confusing! 

I created NoSeat.co to provide clear, concise information about buying public transport tickets in major cities around the world. 
Whether you’re a tourist or a local commuter, I hope this site helps you figure out how to pay for public transport without much hassle.

## How did I choose the name for this site? 

Before you ask, yes: the site name pays explicit homage to [The Man in Seat Sixty-One](https://seat61.com). 
Mark's website has been a true inspiration for NoSeat.co. 
Seat Sixty-one refers to Mark's favourite seat on the Eurostar.
Since we can't make a seat reservation on public transport, our favourite seat is... no seat!
