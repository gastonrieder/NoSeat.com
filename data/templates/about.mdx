# About NoSeat.com

Hello! I'm Gaston, the creator of NoSeat.com. 

I've always been passionate about public transport and urban life in general. I am fascinated by what we can achieve when we come together.



As a result, I've spent a lot of time travelling around the world, exploring different cities.
I noticed that navigation itself was not a problem - Google Maps is usually good enough. 
The problem is actually figuring out what tickets to buy! Is there an app I should download? Or do I go to a vending machine? If so, what tickets do I buy? Ah, I can pay contactless, great... no, wait, I can only do it on buses but not on trams. How confusing! 


One challenge I often faced was understanding how to pay the public transport systems in different cities, especially when it came to buying the right tickets. This website was born out of my desire to make this process easier for everyone.

I created NoSeat.com to provide clear, concise information about buying public transport tickets in major cities around the world. Whether you’re a tourist or a local commuter, I hope this site helps you get where you need to go without any hassle.
Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the information here useful. 

This site is a love letter to public transport. 

Public transport is what makes our cities function. It's what makes them livable. It's what makes them fun. It's what makes them thrive. Without public transport, our cities would not be cities. They would still be villages. 

Public transport is both an invariably universal and intimately local experience. No journey to Paris is complete without travelling on the métro. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more iconic landmark of London than the double-decker bus. And hearing "stand clear of the closing doors please" immediately harks me back to New York.
