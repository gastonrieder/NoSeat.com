## Getting to know the network
Amsterdam's public transport system is efficient, clean, and perfectly integrated with the city's cycling culture.
The iconic blue and white trams are a symbol of the city, complemented by metros, buses, and free ferries across the IJ river.
Getting around on public transport is an excellent way to experience the Dutch capital beyond the canal belt.

Here is an overview of {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s public transport system.
