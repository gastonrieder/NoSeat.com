## Getting to know the network
Amsterdam's public transport system is efficient, clean, and in harmony with the city's cycling culture. 
The Dutch public transport network is so well integrated that the instructions in this page actually apply to all cities in the country!

Here is an overview of {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s public transport system.

If you'd like to read more, refer to this [explainer](URL) (coming soon!).

## How to pay
- Your contactless bank card
- OV-chipkaart
- GVB App
- I amsterdam City Card

### Contactless bank card
Your **contactless bank card** is your ticket! You pay by tapping on any OV reader. You can also pay via Apple Pay or Google Pay on your smartphone or smartwatch. 

**Tips**: 
- Make sure your bank card is enabled for overseas transactions.
- Make sure there are no hidden currency conversions fees. See below for tips on how to avoid these (coming soon).
- For general guidance on using your contactless bank card as a payment method, see our [contactless bank card guide](URL)(coming soon).

If you plan on travelling a lot on a monthly basis, you can also link *some* discounts to your bank card via the GVB App ([Android](https://onelink.to/6p4xaw) & [iOS](https://onelink.to/6p4xaw)).

### OV-chipkaart
The **OV-chipkaart** is the Netherlands' transport smart card. It is valid on all public transport systems throughout the country.
There are **two types** of OV-chipkaart: anonymous and personal. Both have a non-refundable fee of 7.50 â‚¬. 
- Buy your **anonymous** OV-chipkaart at all NS Ticket Machines with OV-chipkaart logo. You can find NS ticket machines at all Dutch railway stations. You can also buy an OV-chipkaart at most Albert Heijn supermarket outlets. 
- Buy your **personal** OV-chipkaart [online](www.ov-chipkaart.nl). You will most likely need a Dutch bank account for this. 
    - Frankly, a personal OV-chipkaart is not worth the hassle unless you plan to spend a few months in the NL.

### GVB App
GVB is the public transport operator in {frontmatter.metaTitle}. This means that tickets will be valid only on GVB services - in practice, all buses and trams within Amsterdam but not trains. 

The **GVB App** ([Android](https://onelink.to/6p4xaw) & [iOS](https://onelink.to/6p4xaw)) is handy in case you want to buy group tickets as well as duration-based tickets (eg., 1-hour, 1-day, multiday, etc.).

### I amsterdam City Card
The **I amsterdam City Card** includes unlimited public transport, plus many other perks such as free entry to museums and canal cruises.
Whether this makes sense to you or not will depend on your plans in the city, but you will probably walk around a lot so it is not worth it just for the public transport. 

## Airports

### Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS)
Take any Amsterdam-bound NS **train**. Contactless or OV-chipkaart are accepted on all services.

## Making the most out of {frontmatter.metaTitle} using public transport!

### Tram 2: second to none when it comes to sightseeing
Tram 2 takes you through the city's most iconic landmarks, so it's a superb way of getting an overview of {frontmatter.metaTitle}.
It starts at **Amsterdam Centraal**, the city's main railway hub, and heads south through the Dam Square, the Leidseplein, and Museumplein before veering south and running parallel to **Vondelpark**, the city's most famous park.

### Free ferry across the IJ!
Perhaps the most attractive element of this ferry is that it's free! This is rather uncommon in Amsterdam, as you'll soon find out. 
The ferries to Buiksloterweg and IJplein do also offer some nice views of the city - I particularly enjoy the contrast between the modern buildings and the old seafront houses and wharfs.
