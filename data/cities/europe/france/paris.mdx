metaDescription: How to pay for public transport in Paris

Paris isn’t just the City of Light—it’s a bustling metropolis that boasts one of the world's largest public transport networks. 
The iconic Art Nouveau metro entrances designed by Hector Guimard are as much a symbol of Paris as the Eiffel Tower itself.

## Getting to know the network
Here is an overview of {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s public transport system.

If you'd like to read more, refer to this [explainer](URL) (coming soon!).

## How to pay
- Navigo Easy
- Digital tickets (via app, Apple Wallet or)
- Physical tickets

### Navigo Easy
You can purchase a Navigo Easy card 
- Buy it at any metro station for €2
- Load it with single tickets or carnets (books of 10 tickets)
- Tap to validate at station gates or on buses
- Share it with travel companions
- Valid for 10 years

### Digital tickets
Modern contactless options:
- Download Île-de-France Mobilités app (Android and iOS)
- Buy tickets directly on your phone
- Use NFC for validation (Android only)
- iPhone users need separate Navigo card

### Physical tickets
Traditional paper tickets are slowly but surely (finally!) being phased out. 
If you err on the old-fashioned side of things, you can still get them at métro ticket machines and in some tobacco shops (which you can spot by looking out for their big red "Tabac" signs)
As with their digital versions, you can buy single tickets or books of 10 for a discount. 

Paper tickets can get easily lost and/or demagnetised, so they are rather impractical. 

### Which payment method should I choose? 

If you have an iPhone

## Airports

### Charles de Gaulle (CDG)
There are two options for getting to the city centre from CDG. You need a special 
- **RER B**:
- **Roissybus**: 

You can buy both tickets online by following the instructions [above](#how-to-pay). There are also ticket machines at the airport.

### Orly (ORY)
- **OrlyBus**: Direct to Denfert-Rochereau
- **Orlyval + RER B**: Fast but expensive
- **Tram T7 + Metro**: Budget option

### Beauvais (BVA)
Paris' low-cost airport does not have any public transport connections. There is a shuttle bus instead; buy tickets and check destinations [here](https://aeroportparisbeauvais.com/acces-et-parking/navette-aerobus-paris-aeroport).

## Making the most out of {frontmatter.metaTitle} using public transport!

### A casually mind-blowing view of the Eiffel Tower!

If you take Line 6 between stations Passy and Bir-Hakeim, you can catch a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower as you cross over the Seine. 
Now that's what I call travelling in style!

The best views are on northbound services (ie., going from Bir-Hakeim to Passy). 
I recommend standing on the right-hand side of the train.

### Hector Guimard's renowned Art Nouveau métro entrances

The famous Art Nouveau métro entrances designed by Hector Guimard rank amongst the most iconic in the world. 
They are also truly unique to Paris (even though there are siome replicas scattered elsewhere). 

You can find the full list on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_M%C3%A9tro_entrances_by_Hector_Guimard#Entrances_extant_today), 
but at some point I will make an interactive map here. If you'd be interested in something like that, please let me know by sending me an [email](mailto:gastonrieder@gmail.com)!
