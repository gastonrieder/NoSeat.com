## Getting to know the network
Paris isn’t just the City of Light—it’s a bustling metropolis that boasts one of the world's largest public transport networks. 
The iconic Art Nouveau metro entrances designed by Hector Guimard are as much a symbol of Paris as the Eiffel Tower itself.

Here is an overview of {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s public transport system.

If you'd like to read more, refer to this [explainer](URL) (coming soon!).

</div>

### Navigo Easy
The **Navigo Easy** is {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s reusable smart card.

You can purchase a Navigo Easy card at any counter at any Paris métro station. 
You can load it with single tickets or books of 10 tickets right there. You can also top it up later at counters or ticket machines. 

### Physical tickets

Traditional paper tickets are slowly but surely (finally!) being phased out. 

If you err on the old-fashioned side of things, you can still get them at métro ticket machines and in some tobacco shops (which you can spot by looking out for their big red "Tabac" signs)
As with their digital versions, you can buy single tickets or books of 10 for a discount. 

<div style={{ 
  float: 'none', 
  margin: '0 0 1em 1em', 
  maxWidth: '300px',
  '@media (max-width: 768px)': {
    float: 'none',
    margin: '1em 0',
    maxWidth: '100%'
  }
}}>

Paper tickets can get easily lost and/or demagnetised - they are rather impractical. 

## Airports

### Charles de Gaulle (CDG)
There are two options for getting to the city centre from CDG.  
- **RER B**
- **Roissybus**

You can buy both tickets online (digital tickets and Navigo Easy options). There are also ticket machines at the airport.

### Orly (ORY)

Information coming soon.

### Beauvais (BVA)
Paris' low-cost airport does not have any public transport connections. There is a shuttle bus instead; buy tickets and check destinations [here](https://aeroportparisbeauvais.com/acces-et-parking/navette-aerobus-paris-aeroport).

## Free and discounted travel for children, senior citizens, etc. (coming soon)

## Making the most out of {frontmatter.metaTitle} using public transport!

### A casually mind-blowing view of the Eiffel Tower!

If you take Line 6 between stations Passy and Bir-Hakeim, you can catch a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower as you cross over the Seine. 
Now that's what I call travelling in style!

The best views are on northbound services (ie., going from Bir-Hakeim to Passy). 
I recommend standing on the right-hand side of the train.

### Hector Guimard's renowned Art Nouveau métro entrances

The famous Art Nouveau métro entrances designed by Hector Guimard rank amongst the most iconic in the world. 
They are also truly unique to Paris (even though there are siome replicas scattered elsewhere). 

You can find the full list on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_M%C3%A9tro_entrances_by_Hector_Guimard#Entrances_extant_today), 
but at some point I will make an interactive map here. If you'd be interested in something like that, please let me know by sending me an [email](mailto:gastonrieder@gmail.com)!
