## Getting to know the network
London’s public transport system is as iconic as the city itself. 
London boasts the world's first underground railway -the Tube- and possibly the world's most iconic bus, the red double-decker. 
Getting around on public tranport is not just convenient, it's a key part of any trip to the Big Smoke. 

Here is an overview of {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s public transport system.

## How to pay
- Your contactless bank card
- Oyster Card

</div>

### Contactless bank card
Your **contactless bank card** is your ticket! You pay by tapping on any yellow reader. You can also pay via Apple Pay or Google Pay on your smartphone or smartwatch. Remember to always use the same device when tapping in and out. 

Your fare will be automatically calculated and deducted. Daily caps are automatically applied. Weekly caps are also automatically applied if you travel from Monday to Sunday. 

**Tips**: make sure your bank card is enabled for contactless payments and overseas transactions. Also make sure there are no hidden currency conversions fees. See below for tips on how to avoid these.
For general guidance on using your contactless bank card as a payment method, see our [contactless bank card guide](URL)

### Oyster Card
The **Oyster card** is {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s reusable smart card:

- Buy it at any London Underground station. Most London Overground and Elizabeth Line stations also offer them. An Oyster card costs £7. The fee is non-refundable.  
- Top it up for PAYG fares or load travelcards onto it. 
- If you have a Railcard, you can add it to your Oyster card for 1/3 savings on off-peak travel on Undergroud, Overground, DLR and National Rail services.  
Anybody can buy a railcard; there is no requirement that you live in the UK or are a UK citizen. 

Only the Railcards below offer discounts on London transport. To check if you qualify for one (and buy it if so), head to [Trainline](https://thetrainline.com/trains/great-britain/railcards). 
- 16-25 Railcard.

- 26-30 Railcard.

- Senior Railcard.

- HM Forces Railcard.

- Veterans Railcard.

- Disabled Person's Railcard.

Once you have your Railcard, you will need to ask a member of staff to add it to your Oyster card. 
You can find them at any major Tube station by the ticket machines. 

### Which payment method should I choose? 

There is no pricing difference between contactless cards and Oyster cards. 
Since you do not have to pay extra for your **contactless card**, I'd recommend going for that. 

Additionally, Oyster cards are only valid in Zones 1-6. Contactless cards are valid further out, and new stations are being progressively added. 
For example, you cannot use Oyster to reach Luton airport, but you can use contactless. The same will apply to Stansted airport once support for contactless is added.

The only scenario where I'd recommend an Oyster card is if you qualify for a Railcard that gives you a discount on London transport and you plan on using it regularly. 
In that case, an Oyster card could turn out to be a lot cheaper than contactless. 

Of course, you should also get an Oyster if you do not have access to a contactless card.
