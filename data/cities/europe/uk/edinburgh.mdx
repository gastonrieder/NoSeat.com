## Getting to know the network
Edinburgh's public transport system is efficient and well-integrated. 
The capital of Scotland combines modern trams with an extensive bus network, making it easy to explore both the historic Old Town and the Georgian New Town.

Here is an overview of {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s public transport system.

If you'd like to read more, refer to this [explainer](URL) (coming soon!).

## Apps for navigating {frontmatter.metaTitle}
1. Citymapper ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.citymapper.app.release&referrer=utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3Dcmweb%253Adesktop%253Awebapp%253Atopnav) & [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/citymapper-all-live-transit/id469463298))
2. Google Maps ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&hl=en) & [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/google-maps/id585027354))
3. Apple Maps (iOS only)
4. There is a Lothian Bus & Tram app, but it does not include local train services so I cannot recommend it for navigation.

## How to pay
How to pay depends on your transport mode - {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s public transport network is unfortunately not integrated.

For **trains** you can buy tickets on the [Scotrail website](https://www.scotrail.co.uk/) or via the Scotrail app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.firstscotrail&utm_source=global_co&utm_medium=prtnr&utm_content=Mar2515&utm_campaign=PartBadge&pcampaignid=MKT-AC-global-none-all-co-pr-py-PartBadges-Oct1515-1) & [iOS](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/scotrail-train-times-tickets/id464015282?mt=8)) or at the station.

For **buses** and **trams** you can pay with:
- Lothian Bus & Tram app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=travel.ticketless.app.lothian) & [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/lothian-buses-edinburgh-trams/id6468092588))
- 
- Ridacard. You can get one Lothian TravelHubs (list [here](https://www.lothianbuses.com/travelhub/))
  - Frankly, a Ridacrd is not worth the hassle unless you plan to use public transport a lot. 



For **buses** you can also pay with:
- Contactless bank card
- Ridacard. You can get one Lothian TravelHubs (list [here](https://www.lothianbuses.com/travelhub/))
  - Frankly, a Ridacrd is not worth the hassle unless you plan to use public transport a lot. 

For **trams** you can pay with:
- Tram ticket machines
- m-tickets (via app)

- Tap on reader when boarding buses

The **Ridacard** is {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s travel smartcard:

- Better value for regular travelers

### m-tickets

### What payment method should I choose? 

Edinburgh is small - you probably won't need to rely heavily on public transport. 
If you are heading in and out of the **airport**, the best option is to get a **day ticket** - that gives you access to both trams and buses for the day, including to the airport. 
For all other days

  - Holyrood Palace
  - Royal Botanic Garden

#### **Bus 23**

Depending on how long they want to spend on the bus, the 35 from Ocean Terminal will take them through the Old Town (Holyrood; High Street; Chambers Street). You could then get off around Lothian Road, and walk down to Shandwick Place to pick up the 26 to head down to Portobello (Princes Street; Regent Road). The 21 from Portobello would take you back to Leith.

Love the 27. From the botanics, up the mound, through tollcross,polwarth, craiglockhart and up to hunters tryst. It's a nice one.
