## Getting to know the network
Edinburgh's public transport system is efficient and well-integrated. 
The capital of Scotland combines modern trams with an extensive bus network, making it easy to explore both the historic Old Town and the Georgian New Town.
Getting around on public transport is the best way to experience this truly magical city.

Here is an overview of {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s public transport system.

Depending on how long they want to spend on the bus, the 35 from Ocean Terminal will take them through the Old Town (Holyrood; High Street; Chambers Street). You could then get off around Lothian Road, and walk down to Shandwick Place to pick up the 26 to head down to Portobello (Princes Street; Regent Road). The 21 from Portobello would take you back to Leith.

Love the 27. From the botanics, up the mound, through tollcross,polwarth, craiglockhart and up to hunters tryst. It's a nice one.
