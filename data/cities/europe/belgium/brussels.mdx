## Getting to know the network
The capital of the EU is well-known for its excellent beers, chocolates, waffles and... car-centric design. 
Avoid the stress of renting a car and stick to public transport instead! 

Here is an overview of {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s public transport system.

| **Transport Mode**         | **Validation Method** | **Pricing Logic**          | **Peak/Off-Peak**         | **Automatic Capping**     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Metro**| Tap in and out, sometimes tap-in only.| Time-based (valid for 1 hour) | No | Yes, daily. |
| **Trams**| Tap on| Time-based (valid for 1 hour) | No | Yes, daily. |
| **Buses**| Tap on| Time-based (valid for 1 hour) | No | Yes, daily. |
| **SNCB/NMBS Trains**| Honour system | Zone-based within Brussels | No | No |
| **De Lijn/TEC Buses**| Tap on | Time-based | No | No |

## How to pay
- Contactless bank card
- MOBIB card
- Digital tickets via app
- Paper tickets

### **Contactless bank card**
Your **contactless bank card** is your ticket! Just tap and go at any blue reader. Avoid the red readers, which are for other payment methods. 
You can also pay via Apple Pay or Google Pay on your smartphone or smartwatch. Remember to always use the same device! 

Your fare will be automatically calculated and deducted. Daily caps are automatically applied. If you notice that you've been charged a higher fare than you anticipated, do not panic! 
This is because you may be charged the daily cap in full when you first tap in. At the end of the day, the system will automatically calculate how much you've actually spent and refund you the difference. 

For general guidance on using your contactless bank card, see our [contactless bank card guide (coming soon)](URL).

### MOBIB card
The **MOBIB card** is {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s reusable smart card. There are two types of MOBIB card. 
- **MOBIB personal card**: for residents and/or frequent travellers.
- **MOBIB basic card**: for tourists and/or occasional travellers. 

Both cost â‚¬6 and are valid for five years, but the personal card can only be bought in person at a STIB-MIVB BOOTIK(list of outlets [here](https://stib-mivb.be/article.html?l=en&_guid=30d93c3b-2b83-3410-94b5-eec92fbd03ff#contentBodyList0)).
You will also have to provide a passport picture and your passport or national identity card if you are not Belgian. All metro stations witih BOOTIK outlets have a passport picture booth. 

A personal card allows you to buy monthly and annual passes, as well as qualify for discounts depending on your age, status, etc. 
If you are not a Brussels resident or frequent traveller, it does not make too much sense to go through this hassle. 

Here is how you can get a **MOBIB basic card**:
- Most metro stations
- Any red GO vending machines with touch screen (available at all metro stations and major tram and bus stops)

  }

</div>

### Paper tickets
You can still buy paper tickets from ticket machines (available at all metro stations and some tram and bus stops). 
Paper tickets are more expensive than digital tickets so are not recommended. 

### Digital tickets
Download the STIB-MIVB app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.stib.mivb.mobile&hl=fr) & [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/be/app/stib-mivb/id1325048789?l=fr-FR)) to buy and store BRUPASS and BRUPASS XL digital tickets on your smartphone.
Unless you are planning on using SNCB/De Lijn/TEC services in Brussels, this is not recommended and you can just use your contactless bank card instead. 
Most tourists will not need to make use of these services. 

## Airports

### Brussels Airport (BRU)
The easiest way from the airport to the city centre is by **train**, with stops at Brussels Central, Brussels North and Brussels Midi stations. 

Download the SNCB app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.sncbnmbs.b2cmobapp) & [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1504870215)) to buy tickets and store them on your phone.
There are also ticket machines at the airport train station, but downloading the app is easier. 

There is also a **busline**, the Airport Line 12.  
You can pay with all payment methods listed above except the STIB-MIVB app, both heading in and out of the airport. 
The airport line has a higher fare when departing from the airport. When heading into the airport, you just pay the normal fare.

### Brussels South Charleroi Airport (CRL)
Brussels' low-cost airport does not have a direct connection to the city centre. 
You can take a shuttle to Brussels Midi railway station (buy tickets [here](https://www.flibco.com/en/shuttle/bus-brussels-charleroi-airport)).

Alternatively, you can buy a Charleroi Airport Ticket using the SNCB app (download links above). This ticket allows you to:
- Travel by train between the Belgian station of your choice and Charleroi-Central.
- Take the TEC bus between Charleroi-Central and Charleroi Airport.

## Making the most out of {frontmatter.metaTitle} using public transport!

### **Through the woods with Tram 44**  
Tram 44 is easily one of the most scenic tram lines in Europe, and well worth a ride just for the views. 

Tram 44 departs from Montgomery and follows the grandiose Avenue de Tervuren past imposing mansions and the modernist Palais Stoclet (a UNESCO World Heritage Site).
But not before long, the tram leaves the city behind and enters the forests of Tervuren. No matter the season, the ride is incredible picturesque. 
The last stop is Tervuren, where you can explore the Royal Museum for Central Africa, well worth a visit. 

By the way, the line also stops at the Tram Museum... which I am sure you'll find interesting to visit if you're on this site ðŸ˜‰ðŸš‹!
