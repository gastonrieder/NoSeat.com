Brussels' trams offer scenic routes through the city. Here are some recommended lines:

### **Tram 44**  
- **Route**: Montgomery ↔ Tervuren  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Cinquantenaire Park
  - Scenic forest route
  - Royal Museum for Central Africa

Down Avenue de Tervuren they rattle, past the grand embassies, the rolling Parc de Woluwe and the modernist masterpiece Palais Stoclet. The stops have elegant green Art Nouveau shelters with evocative names like Jules Cesar, De Villalobar and Chien Vert.

The tram eventually leaves Brussels behind and plunges into the forest, rattling along at top speed, ringing its bell as it approaches crossings. Hikers sometimes get off at the Drève des Brûlés stop to begin a ramble through the woods.

The final stretch follows the broad boulevard created by Leopold II that ends at the old Congo Museum. Time to get off and explore the park.
