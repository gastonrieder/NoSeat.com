If you'd like to read more about this table, refer to this [explainer](URL) (coming soon!).

## How to pay
- Your contactless bank card
- PRESTO Card

### Contactless bank card
Your **contactless bank card** is your ticket! You pay by tapping on any PRESTO reader. You can also pay via Apple Pay or Google Pay on your smartphone or smartwatch. Remember to always use the same device when tapping in and out. 

**Tips**: 
- Make sure your bank card is enabled for contactless payments and overseas transactions.
- Also make sure there are no hidden currency conversions fees. See below for tips on how to avoid these (coming soon).
- For general guidance on using your contactless bank card as a payment method, see our [contactless bank card guide](URL)(coming soon).

### PRESTO Card
The **PRESTO card** is {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s reusable smart card:
You can choose to either get a **physical card** or a **mobile card** on your phone. The mobile card is more convenient of course, plus it's free.
- If you have an **Android phone**, follow these steps: 
  - Download the [Google Wallet app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel&hl=en).
  - Tap "Add to Wallet"
  - Tap "Transit Pass" 
  - Select "PRESTO"
- If you have an **iPhone**, follow these steps: 
  - Open the Apple Wallet app
  - Tap the + button in the top right corner
  - Select the "Add a Transit Card" option
  - Select "PRESTO"
- Buy and top up your **physical PRESTO card** at all TTC Subway stations as well as plenty of convenience storesÂ (Shoppers Drug Mart, etc.). A full list of outlets is available [here](https://www.prestocard.ca/en/find-an-outlet/customer-service-outlets).

### Which payment method should I choose?

There is no pricing difference between contactless cards and PRESTO cards. 
Since you do not have to pay extra for your **contactless card**, I'd recommend going for that.

## Airports

### Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ)
There are two options for getting to and from the airport:
- **UP Express**
  - By far, the most convenient means of transport out there. 
  - Accepts contactless and PRESTO card payments.
- **TTC Airport Rocket Bus (192)**
  - A more unfrequent service, this bus will set you back a regular TTC fare. As such, it also gives you 2 hours on the rest of the network.
  - Accepts contactless and PRESTO card payments.

{/*
### Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (YTZ)
- Free shuttle bus to Union Station
- Short walk to streetcar routes
- Ferry service (included in flight ticket)

## Free and discounted travel
- Children 12 and under ride free on TTC
- Senior and student discounts available with PRESTO
