## Getting to know the network
Hong Kong's public transport system is one of the most popular in the world, with over 70% of daily trips made by public transport in the city! 
The Pearl of the Orient has an efficient network which combines modern MTR trains with iconic "Ding Ding" trams.

Here is an overview of {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s public transport system.

If you'd like to read more, refer to this [explainer](URL) (coming soon!).

## How to pay
- Contactless bank cards
- Octopus Card
- AliPay/WeChat Pay

### Contactless bank card
Your **contactless bank card** is your ticket! You pay by tapping on any NFC reader. You can also pay via Apple Pay or Google Pay on your smartphone or smartwatch. Remember to always use the same device when tapping in and out. 

**Tips**: 
- Make sure your bank card is enabled for contactless payments and overseas transactions.
- Also make sure there are no hidden currency conversions fees. See below for tips on how to avoid these (coming soon).
- For general guidance on using your contactless bank card as a payment method, see our [contactless bank card guide](URL)(coming soon).

### Octopus Card
The **Octopus card** is {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s reusable smart card. 
You can choose to either get a **physical card** or a **mobile card** on your phone. Both cost the same; the mobile card is more convenient of course.

**Fun fact**: it can also be used at tons of retail and food outlets!
- For both kinds of Octopus Card, there is a deposit of ~HK$ 50. This is refunded when you return the card.
- Buy and top up your **mobile Octopus card** via the Octopus App ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/octopus-for-tourists/id1505492952). Android support is coming soon).
- Buy and top up your **physical Octopus card** at all MTR stations as well as plenty of convenience stores (think 7-Eleven, Circle K, etc.).

### AliPay/WeChat Pay
If I understand correctly, you can use **AliPay** and **WeChat Pay** in {frontmatter.metaTitle} if you have a Chinese ID and/or configure it to work in {frontmatter.metaTitle}. 
This takes a bit of time and is not as straightforward as using a contactless bank card or Octopus card, so can't recommend it.

### Which payment method should I choose? 

There is no pricing difference between contactless cards and Octopus cards. 
Since you do not have to pay extra for your **contactless card** and there is no deposit to deal with, I'd recommend going for that.
If you do not live in China, you are unlikely to have AliPay and WeChat Pay. Even then, you need to configure them again for transactions in {frontmatter.metaTitle}, so it's not worth the hassle.

## Airports

### Hong Kong International Airport (HKG)
There are two options for getting to and from the airport:
- **Airport Express**:
  - By far, the easiest way to get to Hong Kong.
  - Pay with contactless or Octopus. 
  - Alternatively, you can get single/return tickets [here](https://www.mtr.com.hk/en/customer/buy_tickets/payment_method.html). However, it's just better to pay contactless or get a mobile Octopus card if you plan on using public tranpsort in {frontmatter.metaTitle} (which you should!).
- **Bus Services**:
  - Buses serving the airport are named "A+number" (eg., A10, A11, etc.).
  - More economical than the Airport Express, with fares averaging HK$50. 
  - Pay with contactless or Octopus.

## Making the most out of {frontmatter.metaTitle} using public transport!
### Explore Hong Kong Island from the city's famous trams (Ding Ding)
Hong Kong's trams are famous for their distinctive "ding ding" sound. They have been around since 1904, and 
are considered to be the ‘largest double-decker tram fleet in service'. They are a great way to soak in the hectic pace of the city. 

Unlike most trams systems, here you get on the tram at the back, and tap on with your contactless bank card or octopus card when alighting from the front.

### Star Ferry
The Star Ferry is a brilliant way to see both sides of {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s famous Victoria Harbour.

Don't miss out on the **Symphony of lights**! At 8 pm sharp, the Harbour lights up with a spectacular light show for 10 minutes. 
I recommend heading northbound from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon close to 8 pm. That way you will catch the best views from the water.
