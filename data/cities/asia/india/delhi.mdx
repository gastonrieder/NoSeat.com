## Getting to know the network
Delhi's public transport system is a source of pride for Indians, and rightfully so. 
The Delhi Metro is one of Asia's largest and most modern metro systems, complemented by an extensive bus network and the city's iconic auto-rickshaws.
Getting around on public transport in Delhi is an experience in and of itself. Hop on!

Here is an overview of {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s public transport system.

If you'd like to read more, refer to this [explainer](URL) (coming soon!).

| **Transport Mode**          | **Validation Method**       | **Pricing Logic**          | **Peak/Off-Peak Fares**         | **Automatic Capping**     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Metro**                   | Tap in and out              | Distance-based             | No                        | No                        |

## Apps for navigating {frontmatter.metaTitle}
Apps for public transport directions in order of recommendation:
1. Google Maps ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&hl=en) & [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/google-maps/id585027354))

I would love to recommend the One Delhi App ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.delhitransport.onedelhi&hl=en) & [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/one-delhi/id1641749010)). I haven't used this option, so [feedback](mailto:gastonrieder@gmail.com) is welcome!

3. Tummoc ([Android](https://0x92l.app.link/mql2Jm1fqvb) & [iOS](https://0x92l.app.link/mql2Jm1fqvb)). The idea behind this app sounds great, but the app is available only for Indian users unfortunately.

How to pay depends on your transport mode - {frontmatter.metaTitle}'s public transport network is unfortunately not integrated.

For **metro** you can pay with:
